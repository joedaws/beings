# Beings

An elixir app for simulating a large collection of eldrich beings floating through the cosmos, living the social
lives that eldrich beings appearently have.

## Progress so far

As you can see, not very far.

Basically all that works are the tests.

``` bash
mix test
```

## Progress Goals 

- Define the data and functions on that data that make up the beings. 
- Define a suitable cosmos where these beings can live and roam.
- Create parameters which define different kinds of cosms where these beings have interesting emergent interactions.
- Build a visualizaiton tool for the simulation.
