# Beings

An elixir app for simulating a large collection of eldrich beings floating through the cosmos, living the social
lives that eldrich beings appearently have.

## Progress so far

As you can see, not very far.

Basically all that works are the tests.

``` bash
mix test
```

## Goals 

- [ ] Define a suitable cosmos where these beings can live and roam.
- [x] Define the data and functions the beings. 
- [ ] parameterize the social connections of beings.
- [ ] Build a visualizaiton tool for the simulation.
