#+TITLE: Stream Goals

* DONE implement ranks
* TODO implement ichor generation from node
** DONE nodes have ichor_supply
** DONE beings have location
** DONE change node occupancy when visited by a being
* TODO implement beings function that collects resources
Probably means that we need a function to look at all beings at a certain node
and decides who gets what. Does it make sense for a being registry to take care of this?
* TODO add ichor generation to nodes
* TODO simple script to run
